All statistical R codes used to implement a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation tent Class algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the dependence parameters of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model are provided in a package named copulaIVTS. 

Details are described in the manuscript "Estimation of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model by Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation", and further described in PhD Thesis format here ("https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/54587851/FULL_TEXT.PDF").
