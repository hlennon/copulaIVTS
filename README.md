The R package `copulaIVTS` provides all statistical R used to implement a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the dependence parameters of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model. Useful for count time series also.   


Details are described in the manuscript "Estimation of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model by Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation",   
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2018.10.015     

and further described in PhD Thesis format here [https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/54587851/FULL_TEXT.PDF "Lennon, H., 2016. Gaussian copula modelling for integer-valued time series").   



Please note, there are two alternative estimation methods to fit the digitised Gaussian ARMA model provided in the Thesis link;   
- via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and   
- via approximate MLE via a d-vine bivariate copula representation.
