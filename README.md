All statistical R codes used to implement a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the dependence parameters of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model are provided in a package named copulaIVTS. 

Details are described in the manuscript "Estimation of a digitised Gaussian ARMA model by Monte Carlo Expectation Maximisation", and further described in PhD Thesis format here [https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/54587851/FULL_TEXT.PDF "Lennon, H., 2016. Gaussian copula modelling for integer-valued time series").   
Please note, there are two alternative estimation methods provided in the Thesis; Approximate Bayesian Computation and approximate MLE via a d-vine bivariate copula representation.
